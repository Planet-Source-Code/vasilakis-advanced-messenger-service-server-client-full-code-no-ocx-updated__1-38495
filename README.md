### Description

This is a messenger service created just for fun. It is very nice written, and *as much as I could* bug-free. It includes: the Messenger client, the messenger Server, the Banner Server and the database of the program for SQL Server. It support multi-file transfer, email checking and many other features. It is just like MSN Messenger but of course not that advanced :P You should see it, it might help you a lot. Everything is pure source code. That means you need a lot of api calls :p The projects does not have comments, but I think it won't be very difficult to understand my functions and subs. Please send me a feedback, or email me for any questions at vasilis@vasilakis.com. *NOW SUPPORT MS ACCESS*
